# Knowledge Graphs at The Web Conference 2020 (WWW'20)

Knowledge graph is a hot topic in the Web Conference 2020, with tasks of entity alignment, relation extraction, knowledge graph completion and refinement intensively studied. 
This paper list briefs those nice works. 

Some interesting findings: 

1) Many papers propose methods exploiting rich information such as [multi-type entities and neighborhood information](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380289), [structural information and correlation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380257) and [user-item interaction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380155);

2) Low resource settings are paid great attention, for example, relation extraction by [Zhou et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380282), [MetaNER](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380127) and [KGC with adversarial network](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380089);

3) Rule mining is also an interesting direction, with papers like [NERO](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380282) and [KGist](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380189);

4) Graph neural networks and adversarial learning are definitely among the most popular topics, such as [[He et al.]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380155) and [[Cao et al.]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06397.pdf).

Last but not least, there are a paper on [storage architecture](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380246), a resource article of [event knowledge graph](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380107), and three downstream applications of [recommendation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380098), [QA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380197), and [keyword search](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380110).
