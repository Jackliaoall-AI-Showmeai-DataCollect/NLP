Problems: OOV  -> commonsense KG -> triplet without semantic meaning of subgraph  
Proposed Mehtod: commonsense knowledge aware conversational model, CCM; subgraph, static graph attention; dynamic graph attention; encoder-decoder seq2seq  
Datasets: ConceptNet, reddit post-response  
Metirc: perplexity, entity score, crowdsourcing(appropriateness, informativeness)
