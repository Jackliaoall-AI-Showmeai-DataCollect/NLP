Motivation: distance supervised relation extraction; false annotation, inner-sentence noise, random feature extraction is not robust.  
Method: 1) STP: Sub-Tree Parser; BGRU: Bidirectional GRU, entity-wise neural extractor; 3) transfer learning: entity classification -> relation extraction  
Experiments: held-out evaluation, manual evaluation
